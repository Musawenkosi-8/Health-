# healthcare-mental-health-analysis
üß† Problem Definition

Objective:
To analyze and model the mental health status of healthcare workers by identifying key factors that influence stress, burnout, job satisfaction, mental health absences, and turnover intention.

Real-world context:
Healthcare workers are under immense pressure, especially post-pandemic. Understanding what leads to burnout, mental health leaves, or resignations can help policymakers and hospital administrators make data-driven decisions to improve staff well-being.
üîç Processes Followed

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

        Summary statistics and distribution of variables like stress level, burnout frequency, satisfaction scores.

        Visualizations: heatmaps, histograms, boxplots to uncover patterns and outliers.

        Correlation analysis between mental health metrics and demographic/job-related features.

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

        Checked for missing values or anomalies.

        Encoded categorical features (e.g., job roles, departments).

        Scaled numeric features for modeling.

    Feature Engineering:

        Created new features or aggregated indicators (e.g., average mental health score, composite burnout index).

        Binned age groups or categorized satisfaction levels.

    Modeling:

        Applied machine learning models to predict key outcomes, such as:

            Burnout frequency

            Mental health leave (binary classification)

            Turnover intention (binary classification)

        Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

        Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix.

    Model Interpretation:

        Used SHAP values or feature importance plots to understand what drives mental health challenges.

    Actionable Insights:

        Identified key risk factors (e.g., long work hours, low job satisfaction, high stress).

        Suggested interventions (like mental health programs or scheduling changes) based on findings.

‚úÖ Outcomes

    Built predictive models that can identify employees at high risk of mental health struggles or quitting.

    Uncovered key drivers of burnout: long hours, low job satisfaction, lack of mental health resources.

    Developed a reproducible notebook with data visualization, modeling, and recommendations.

    Provides a data-driven foundation for healthcare HR teams to proactively support staff mental wellness.
